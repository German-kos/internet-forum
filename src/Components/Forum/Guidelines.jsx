      <ol>
        <li>
          Respect others’ opinions – We all have opinions and want to express
          them. Attack ideas, not people. Come up with a well-thought out
          counterpoint, or just move on. Abusive comments will not be tolerated,
          and we reserve the right to remove the comment without warning and/or
          ban you.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don’t promote or sell your goods – That’s what advertising is for, and
          we’ve got spots for that. You be cheap, we be deletin’. No SPAMing of
          any kind will be tolerated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fanboy banter will not be tolerated – If you have nothing better to
          say than “[ insert brand/OS of preference ] rulz!!!” then don’t
          bother. It’s lame and you sound dumb. Every brand/OS/product/etc has
          its positives and negatives, uses, etc. If you don’t know this, you
          should just keep reading until you do.
        </li>
        <li>
          No trolling – You know the type – the ones that like to disrupt normal
          on-topic discussion with off-topic comments in a sole effort to bait,
          irritate and cause disruption and mayhem. Don’t feed the trolls, take
          the bait and ruin the conversation for everyone else. Report them and
          move on.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be kind to new users – As you were once a new user, be kind and
          helpful to the new folks.
        </li>
        <li>
          No profanity, racial slurs and/or sexual innuendos – If you wouldn’t
          say it in front of your grandmother or kids, then don’t say it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep it on topic – If you want to go off topic, please check out our
          After Hours Forum Board on TechRepublic.com.
        </li>
        <li>
          No Piracy or unlawful activities – This community forum is a place for
          ideas and constructive participation, and not a place to violate any
          laws or to discuss illegal activities. You post it, we will ban your
          account and you run the risk of being reported to the local
          authorities.
        </li>
        <li>
          No flaming – Goes with being respectful of others. Resist the urge,
          and be respectful and objective at all times. You flame, we torch.
          Your account becomes toast. And not the tasty kind.
        </li>
